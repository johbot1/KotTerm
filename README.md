# KotTerm
One of three Kotlin related projects for my final semester, this one a Terminal project


# Requirements
Kotlin v2.1.10 (JRE 23.0.2)
Java v23.0.2

Ensure you have Kotlin by running the following command in a terminal
`kotlin -version` 
Ensure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) by running the following command in a terminal
`java - version

# How to Run:
- Download the files, then navigate to the directory they are stored in via a command line
- Run the following command:
  -   `kotlinc Main.kt CalculationResult.kt -include-runtime -d kotapp.jar`
  -   This will create a ".jar" file to run with the Java Environment
- Finally, run the following command to run the program:
  - `java -jar kotapp.jar`
